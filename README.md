This is a project that I have been working on for a while that I'm finally uploading here.

This datapack modifies Zombies, Husks, and Drowned, it adds multiple types of zombies based off of the last of us.

I tried to keep all the code in order and made it in a way that prevents lag on servers, so you can use this on servers with a lot of people.

# BE WARNED:
This datapack tweaks difficulty, game mechanics, and the like. Add to your world/server at your own risk.
THIS DATAPACK TWEAKS DIFFICULTY TO BE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT, THIS IS ON PURPOSE. fork this project if you dont like the difficulty.

# NOTES:
This datapack is best used with Fresh Animations and Tissou's Zombie Pack.
